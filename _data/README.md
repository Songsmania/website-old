# Biographies

The website adds biographies automatically by grabbing all the data from a single file, `bios.yml`.

## Getting Started

1. Open `bios.yml`
2. Fill out all the fields, ensuring that the `firstname` field starts with a dash (`-`) character. See the current file for examples.
3. Save and make a pull request!
